This is repo for experimenting on Ractive Components and it's loaders.

1. RactiveLoad - Uses [ractive.load](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive-load).

   This is a direct copy of example from this [documentation](https://github.com/ractivejs/component-spec/#available-loaders). Currently, this error is being encountered,  

     ```
    Uncaught TypeError: e.Promise is not a constructor
    at ractive-load.min.js:1
    at m (ractive-load.min.js:1)
    at Function.R [as load] (ractive-load.min.js:1)
    at localhost/:10r
